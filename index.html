            <p>“For me when I go to sacred places the first thing I do is greet the landscape. Always remember to show
                respect and give offerings like cornmeal. Bears Ears is powerful. We come here for ceremonies, guidance,
                and inspiration. Acknowledge all life within the landscape, this is their home. Wherever you are,
                whoever you are, make sure you show respect. We must never abuse our privileges. It’s important to
                understand that this is our home and will continue to be so long as we take care of it</p>

                <h3>Customers</h3>
                <p>Customer is an individual, group of individuals or an organization who receive or may receive goods,
                    services, products or ideas from another individual or a company in return of value which can be
                    money or anything of equivalent value. Customer forms the backbone of business. Usually more is the
                    number of customers, more is the business thriving and vice versa. Business needs customers to buy
                    their products or services. A customer may not be buying your product right away but may buy it in
                    future but still remains part of your target customer group.</p>

                <h3>TOOUR With US!</h3>
                <p>Why visit the Amazon rainforest in Brazil?
                    Whereas other gateways are set along tributaries or smaller sections of the River Amazon, Manaus
                    allows you to see this river in all its glory. Despite being over 1,500 kilometers from the Atlantic
                    coast, the river is 10 kilometers wide here. So this is the perfect destination for those wanting to
                    marvel at its sheer size and scale.
                    Manaus also offers the opportunity to witness the ‘Meeting of the Waters’. This is where the Rio
                    Solimões and the Rio Negro merge to form what we know as the River Amazon. As each river is of a
                    starkly different color, they don’t blend straight away, creating a fascinating natural phenomenon.
